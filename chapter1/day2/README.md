## Chapter 1 - Day 2

1. What are the 5 Cadence Programming Language Pillars?
    * Safety and Security, Clarity, Approachability, Developer Experience, Resource Oriented Programming
2. In your opinion, even without knowing anything about the Blockchain or coding, why could the 5 Pillars be useful (you don't have to answer this for #5)?
    1. Safety and Security
        * I think these are the cornerstone of every sucesffully blockchain (or at least they should be...). We need to ensure that any system we place our trust into is safe to operate with and is secure from both internal and external threats.
    2. Clarity
        * For me, clarity really builds on top of safety and security. As technology controls more and more of our lives we need to provide a way for people to understand what the code they are interacting with is doing. We see it all the time in scams from every industry that play on peoples lack of understanding to exploit them. Making the code easier to read is fundemental in helping people understand what the code is doing.
    3. Approachability
        * This one is a no brainer... unless the code is easier to learn, no one will take the time to learn it. If no one is developing on the platform user will leave it in favor of another platform that has projects or app the user is looking for... Yes I am looking at you Microsoft Phone...
    4. Developer Experience
        * This also builds upon Approachability. You need developers to like writing code for a paticular platform otherwise they simply won't do it
    5. Resource Oriented Programming
        * While not required I thought Resrouce Oriented Programming was an important item to cover. Many of the flaws in other blockchain's smart contracts is that they really where not built for the ownership of resources. There are many reason why the current structures don't work well but most all of them are there because they a shoe horned into a platform built to operate like one long accounting ledger. With Resource Oriented Programming we can finally start brining addtional industries into the Web3 space because of the security and overall data structures implemented that are not possible in other blockchains.

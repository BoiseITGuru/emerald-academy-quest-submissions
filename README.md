  1. A blockchain is a distributed public database and/or storage system depending on how you look at it. Because all of the data is replicated across every node (in most blockchain at least) in theory the data will always exist in an immutable state as long as one copy of the nodes exist. The data is typically stored in what is reffered to as the "ledger", this is what allows all the data to be publicly verfied by anyone. One of the main advantges to public blockchains is the ability for anyone to connect to the blockchain and execute transactions as long as they have a wallet and an internet connection. Blockchains use cryptography to not only verify you are authorized to make a certain transactions but also for securing the blockchain using either Proof of Work or Proof of Stake methods.

2. A smart contract is a set of functions or variables stored on the blockchain that wallets can interact with. My favorite way to explain them is "Law as Code" taken from the wording in the Wyoming, USA DAO LLC laws. Since smart contracts are immutable on most blockchains they provide a transparent and trusted way for people and organizations to interact with each other..thus any code written becomes the law for all interactions good or bad.

3. Scripts are for reading the Flow blockchain while Transactions interact with it or "write" to it costing gas fees.
